<font size="3"> 

This app implements a deterministic branching model for COVID-19 contact tracing.  The model was developed by Alyssa Bilinski, Farzad Mostashari, and Joshua Salomon.  We thank Ashley Tuite and Monica Farid for their feedback on this app.  Direct questions to <abilinski@g.harvard.edu>.  Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abilinski/spark_control).  Additional models and apps can be found at the COVID-19 Statistics, Policy modeling and Epidemiology Collective [website](https://covid-spec.org).
